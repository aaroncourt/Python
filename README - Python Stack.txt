Hello,

I created this repository so that you can see what I learned and worked on as part of my coding bootcamp's curriculum for the Python stack. In this stack we are learning Python, Flask, Jinja, and MySql, and SQL server. In addition we are learning the basics of database design and security.

As for the format of this repository, it is arranged by each chapter, then by sub-chapter, and finally by assignment. Each assignment folder is named by the type of assignment and the assignment name. The type of assignments are as follows:

1. Practice: These assignments are meant to get us familiar with specific topics or concepts pertaining to the chapter we are in. These assignments are not required to be completed in order to pass the course.

2. Core: These assignments are meant to combine knowledge gained from the practice assignments. These assignments are required to be completed in order to complete the stack and graduate from the program.

3. Optional: These assignments are meant to stretch and challenege our newly learned skills from completed core assignments. These assignments help demonstrate our knowledge of the content in addition to problem solving skills. These assignment are not requred to pass the course.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Aaron Court
